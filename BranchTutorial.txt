this is not yet implemented for factorized banner

there are 4 variants of mean prediction:
-zero: the original variant
-fully_dependent: mu is based on the same latent gaussian processes as sigma
- shared: mu has its own latent dimension but also still uses all of the dimensions nu that sigma also uses.
- independent: mu only uses its own latent dimension. The variance does not determine how mu behaves.

mnu is the additional dimension used by mu,
it is 1 for shared and independent and 0 for zero and fully_depndent
